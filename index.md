## Overview

Plants are a major component of nearly all terrestrial ecosystems, as well as most aquatic ecosystems. 
Understanding the patterns and processes of plant distributions, evolutionary development, and taxonomy is necessary to understand our environment more generally. 
In this course, the interrelationships of plant lineages will be discussed, the methods of plant identification will be learned, the multiple processes that result in the patterns of plant distributions will be examined, and the knowledge of botany and plant ecology will be used to carryout original research in a collaborative atmosphere. 
Specific topics covered will include photosynthesis and respiration, plant physiology and morphology as they relate to function and taxonomic classification, and the economic importance of plants from an ecological and environmental impact perspective.
