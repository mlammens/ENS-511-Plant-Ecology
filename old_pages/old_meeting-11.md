## Special lecture / combined class with Environmental Law

Have you wondered about how local governments – counties, cities, towns, and villages – protect and conserve the environment? What authority do these municipalities have to enact law and ordinances that foster sustainable communities?  How do local governments address non-point source pollution (runoff), land use development, green infrastructure and climate change?  The role of municipalities and states is likely to expand under President-elect Trump’s administration.  Learn how these local governments are up for the task. 
 
Answers to these questions will be discussed by nationally-renowned professor of law, John R. Nolon, of the Elisabeth Haub School of Law on Wednesday, November 30th from 4:30pm – 7:30pm in Miller Hall, room 36.  Prof. Nolon founded the Land Use Law Center, through which he has trained government staff, citizens, advocates, planners, attorneys, real estate industry leaders, and other professionals to help enable them to achieve their development and conservation goals.  He will guest lecture in Prof. Michelle Land's Environmental Law class to discuss some of the policy and law tools available to local municipalities.
