## ENS 511 Plant Ecology - Assignment 7 - DUE 11/16/2016 by 4:30 PM

1. Read the Nicotra et al 2011 paper (attached)
	* Link three concepts discussed in this paper with those discussed in Gurevitch et al, Chaps 2 and 3
	* Each ‘link’ you make should be explained in short (2 – 3 sentences) answer response.

2. Examine the transpiration dataset from the experiment we setup last Wednesday evening ([link to data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1auhExamHkvtFa2GdDZ5u_VGHK2riDF2SPKSVJlCUC7g/edit#gid=0)). Note that I took three more measurements on Thursday morning at 9 AM (Thu\_9\_Weight\_Pre), Thursday afternoon at 4 PM (Thu\_16\_Weight), and Friday afternoon at 5 PM (Fri\_17\_Weight). I also added water to the tubes on Thursday morning, but not at any other time.
	* Calculate the amount of water transpired per hour for each interval
	* Compare different transpiration rates for the different species and time intervals
		* Offer one possible explanation for some of these differences
		* Describe an experimental setup you can use to test/investigate your explanation.
