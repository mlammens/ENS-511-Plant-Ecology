## ENS 511 Plant Ecology - Assignment 8 - DUE 12/07/2016 by 4:30 PM

Background reading for this section is Gurevitch et al. Chapter 4. I recommend reading the introduction and summary sections, familiarizing your self with the figures, and skimming the headings.

1. Collect a soil-sample to bring to class with you on Wednesday. We will analyze these samples together during class. Your soil sample should consist of soil collected by digging a hole of approximately 5 cm diameter x 15 cm depth (or about 3 inches x 6 inches).

2. Read the Breeman et al. 1997 paper and prepare a short summary of the paper, approximately 150 words.

3. Provide me with a short description of your final project, between 150 and 250 words.
