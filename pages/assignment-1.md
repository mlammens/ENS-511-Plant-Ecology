## ENS 511 Plant Ecology - Assignment 1 - DUE 9/14/2016 by 4:30 PM

### Part 1 - iNaturlist

You will use iNaturalist to note your plant observations and identifications this semester. 
As a way to familiarize yourself with this platform, do the following:

1. If you haven't already, make an account for yourself at [iNaturalist](http://www.inaturalist.org).
2. Once you're account is established, search for my account (user name: mlammens) and "follow" me. I will follow you back. This will let me track your progress toward your 50 observations.
3. Look for the "Project" titled "Pace Plants". If you make an observation on the Pace campus, then please add it to this project.
4. Finally, add your fist observation. This should be the observation we made in class Wednesday.

### Part 2 - Plant demography

There are two readings for this assignment.

First, go to the PlantPopNet research project [website](http://plantago.plantpopnet.com/home). 
Read the brief introductory material on the home page. Then go to the [Protocol](http://plantago.plantpopnet.com/protocol) tab, scroll to the bottom of the page, and find the link to 
**Plantago protocol_2016 update.pdf**. Read up-to, but not including, **Part 3** of the protocol. I expect you to do a close reading of the protocol.

Second, read chapter 5 of Gurevitch et al. *Ecology of Plants*. I expect you to know the major points from this chapter (i.e., make sure you know what material is in each section).

After doing the reading, answer the following questions (in short paragraph form).

1. Assume you have collected multiple years of data on *Plantago lanceolata* following the protocol you read. How would you use these data to construct a model to understand its demography? (**Note:** While it will be easiest to answer this question after reading Gurevitch et al. CH 5, [this document](https://www.cbd.int/doc/pa/tools/A%20Practical%20Handbook%20for%20Population%20Viability%20Analysis.pdf) by Morris et al. (1999)[^1] is a reasonable alternative, particularly the information in chapter 3.)

2. Choose one example of a model noted in Gurevitch et al. CH 5, and briefly describe what the model was, and what the results showed.

3. Identify one question concerning population demography that you would like answered. This can be technical or more general. Come to class on Wednesday ready to ask this question.
