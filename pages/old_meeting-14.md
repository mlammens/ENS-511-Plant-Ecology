This meeting will focus on applying the tools of biogeography to examine plant species distributions. 
For this meeting you will have to install the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) software. 
Both are free.
Then follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/wallaceEcoMod/wallace) to install the `Wallace` package.
