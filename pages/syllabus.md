### Description

Plants are a major component of nearly all terrestrial ecosystems, as
well as most aquatic ecosystems. Understanding the patterns and
processes of plant distributions, evolutionary development, and taxonomy
is necessary to understand our environment more generally. In this
course, the interrelationships of plant lineages will be discussed, the
methods of plant identification will be learned, the multiple processes
that result in the patterns of plant distributions will be examined, and
the knowledge of botany and plant ecology will be used to carryout
original research in a collaborative atmosphere. Specific topics covered
will include photosynthesis and respiration, plant physiology and
morphology as they relate to function and taxonomic classification, and
the economic importance of plants from an ecological and environmental
impact perspective.

### Course goals

-   To acquire important knowledge of plant ecology.

-   To gain an understanding of the important role plants play in
    ecosystem function and maintenance of life on earth.

-   To gain experience applying the scientific method to carryout
    original research.

### Learning objectives

-   Learn and master basic concepts of ecology.

-   Learn and master concepts of plant population biology.

-   Learn plant physiology and morphology, and understand how these
    characteristics are related to taxonomy.

-   Learn the common flora of the Hudson Valley region.

-   Learn and practice plant identification.

-   Be able to identify major vegetation types in the Hudson Valley
    region.

-   Understand how plants interact with each other and other organisms
    in the community to form the foundation of most ecosystems.

-   Learn and practice the scientific method via group and individual
    projects.

-   Learn and practice how to collaboratively investigate unanswered
    questions in science.

### Required materials

2nd Ed*. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sutherland, MA.

Peer-reviewed articles will also be assigned throughout the semester.
These will be provided as the course progresses.

### Recommended materials

Assignments, assessments, and evaluations
-----------------------------------------

### Weekly assignments 

There will be an assignment each week, due by the start of
class the following week.

### iNaturalist contributions

You are required to contribute at least 50 entries to iNaturalist.
Further details will be provided in class.

### Course project

Students will plan and carryout
a plant ecology project during the semester. The project will
culminate in a presentation to all members of the class and a
written report.

Course Policies
---------------

### Attendance

Attendance and punctuality are required. Excused absences will be
considered, but must be discussed with Prof. Aiello-Lammens. Unexcused
absences and/or consistent lateness will negatively impact a student’s
final assessment and could result in failure.

### Technology in the Classroom

Use of computers and tablets may be necessary to complete some in-class
assignments. However, I expect you to respectful and professional, and
not to be “surfing the internet” during class. If I witness this
activity, you will not be allowed to use technology in the classroom
thereafter.

### Academic integrity

All members of the Pace community are expected to behave with honesty
and integrity, as outlined in the student handbook. The following
statement is from the Student Handbook:

> Students are required to be honest and ethical in satisfying their
> academic assignments and requirements. Academic integrity requires
> that, except as may be authorized by the instructor, a student must
> demonstrate independent intellectual and academic achievements.
> Therefore, when a student uses or relies upon an idea or material
> obtained from another source, proper credit or attribution must be
> given. A failure to give credit or attribution to ideas or material
> obtained from an outside source is plagiarism. Plagiarism is strictly
> forbidden. Every student is responsible for giving the proper credit
> or attribution for any quotation, idea, data, or other material
> obtained from another source that is presented (whether orally or in
> writing) in the student’s papers, reports, submissions, examinations,
> presentations and the like.
>
> Individual schools and programs may have adopted additional standards
> of academic integrity. Therefore, students are responsible for
> familiarizing themselves with the academic integrity policies of the
> University as well as of the individual schools and programs in which
> they are enrolled. A student who fails to comply with the standards of
> academic integrity is subject to disciplinary actions such as, but not
> limited to, a reduction in the grade for the assignment or the course,
> a failing grade in the assignment or the course, suspension and/or
> dismissal from the University.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

The University’s commitment to equal educational opportunities for
students with disabilities includes providing reasonable accommodations
for the needs of students with disabilities. To request an accommodation
for a qualifying disability, a student must self-identify and register
with the Coordinator of Disability Services for his or her campus. No
one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need and arrange
for an accommodation except the Coordinator of Disability Services.
Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact the
Coordinator of Disability Services on behalf of a student. For further
information, please see Information for Students with Disabilities on
the University’s web site.\
To receive accommodation for any disability, students must contact the
campus Counseling Center (Pace Plaza, 212-346-1526; Westchester,
914-773-3710).
