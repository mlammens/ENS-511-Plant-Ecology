### iNaturalist

Install iNaturalist on your phone and make an account. We’ll be using this for making plant records this semester. Send me your user name once you’ve established an account.

### Reading response

Read the Blossey et al. paper and look over the additional methods description.

After reading the papers, write a 350 to 500 word response.
Use 150 to 200 words to summarize the article in a way that is helpful for you.
Then, use the remainder of the words to compare the methods used here with the setup we worked on last Wednesday, and to hypothesize on what types of results Ralph might expect this year.

For those of you who couldn’t make it to the last class, use the remainder of the words to describe how you would design a study if you were interested in the effects of the density of Quercus rubra on deer herbivory.
