## ENS 511 Plant Ecology - Assignment 6 - DUE 11/09/2016 by 4:30 PM

1. Look over the data we collected on leaf stomata density, area, and fresh and dry weight [recorded here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CMUYaGOcKGNLoSYK9wplaa-3axlAxDkwkXnRMzmTfWo/edit?usp=sharing). Using these data, choose one comparison you are interested in - e.g., leaf-area differences due to species, stomata density differences due to ecological conditions, etc. Using a [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test), assess the degree to which any observed differences are significant. Show your work for each calculation required (you can submit a separate Excel, R workbook, etc. for this). 

2. Write an explanation for the results from **1.** Base your explanation on your growing knowledge of plant ecology, particularly on material discussed in the Gurevitch et al. textbook.

3. In this assignment, we are essentially examining our data and interpreting it *post hoc*, or after-the-fact. What advantages do you see in such a *post hoc* analysis? What potential dis-advantages are there to this kind of analysis and interpretation, and how might *a priori* hypothesis formulation and testing help us alleviate these challenges?
