## ENS 511 Plant Ecology - Assignment 3 

This assignment covers Community Ecology of plants. 
The associated reading is Chapter 9 in the Gurevitch et al. textbook and the Introduction to the Biodiversity Assessment Manual for the Hudson River Estuary Corridor (emailed). 
Additionally, look through the habitat descriptions in the Biodiversity Assessment Manual, paying close attention to those we may encounter in the field this coming week.

After reading chapter 9, answer the following questions, which are derived from the "Questions for Further Study" in the textbook:

1. Briefly describe the major contriversies in community ecology. Why do you think it is important to study the historical development of a field in science?

2. What is meant by the term "emergent property"? Explain a property of a community that might be considered "emergent".

3. What is the difference between richness and diversity? How do richness and diversity differ in their affects on community properties? If you were carrying out a biodiversity assessment, which measure do you think would be more critical, and why?
