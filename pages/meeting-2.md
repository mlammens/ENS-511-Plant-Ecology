## Plant Identification and Species Accumulation

In this class, we will walk two transects in the upland forest area on the Pace PLV campus, practicing our plant identification skills. 
We will use iNaturalist and multiple different plant identification books to determine what plants are in this section of woods, and calculate the rate of species accumulation as we move further along the transect.
