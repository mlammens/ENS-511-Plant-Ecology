## Leaf Trait Measurements

This week we will collect leaf samples from plants in our survey plots to measure two leaf treats - Leaf Mass Area (LMA) and Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC). 
Our sampling scheme is to collect leaves from **3 individuals** from each of the species that occur in the plot. 
If a species is rare in the plot, or if the species is one such that a leaf sample is likely to result in a large effect on the survival of the individual, then samples can be collected from individuals of the same species who are outside the plot.
