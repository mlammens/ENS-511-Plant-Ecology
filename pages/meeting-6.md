## Leaf Trait Measurements (cont'd) and Canopy Openness

We will continue to measure leaf traits, as we did during [Meeting 5](meeting-5.html), and will take our dry weight measurements for leaves collected last week. 
We will also measure canopy openness using densiometers and a fish-eye camera lens.
