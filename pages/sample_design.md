# Vegetation Plot Sampling Protocol

We will sample between four and eight plots on the Pace University â€“ Pleasantville campus.
Our sampling will be in line with what is used to measure vegetation around nest sites in the [USGS Breeding Bird Survey project](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/).
The GPS points will serve as a means of finding the center of each plot.
The center will be marked temporarilly with a flag, and permenatnly with a metal pipe at a later time.
From the center, a circle with 11 meter radius will be measured, and within this circle, all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 9 CM will be identified.
Within a circle with a 5 meter radius, all species will be identified (to the extent possible) and a Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance rank will be assigned.
For difficult to identify species (sedges and grasses), we will make one measurement of cover-abundance for all species combined, then to the extent possible, a measure for each species separately.
