## ENS 511 Plant Ecology - Assignment 2 

This assignment covers Growth and Reproduction in Plants. 
The associated reading is Chapter 7 in the Gurevitch et al. textbook and the following paper:

**Smith, G. R., H. A. Dingfelder, and D. A. Vaala. 2003. Effect of plant size and density on garlic mustard reproduction. Northeastern Naturalist 10:269â€“276.**

You can access this peer-reviewed publication through the Pace University Library website. **Come to class prepared to discuss this paper.**

After completing the reading, complete the following tasks and answer these questions:

1. Briefly describe reproduction in *Alliaria petiolata* (Garlic Mustard).

2. Describe on way plants may prevent self-fertilization.

3. Describe the differences between **monoicous** and **dioicous** plants. Name one species for each of these types of plants that occurs in our region. Find each in our area, and add your observation to iNaturalist.

4. Identify one plant that is wind pollinated that occurs in our region. Find it in our area, and add your observation to iNaturalist.

5. Identify one plant that can grow by vegetative growth and occurs in our region. Find it in our area, and add your observation to iNaturalist.

6. Last week we discussed demographic modeling of plants. Describe how you would incorporate a seedbank stage into such a model. (**Note:** it might be best to do this with a diagram and brief figure legend.)
