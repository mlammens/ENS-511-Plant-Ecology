You are expected to plan and carry out either a plant ecology related project or a review, to be submitted at the end of the semester (DUE 2016-DEC-21).
The final submission will include a paper and a 12 minute presentation.

## Project guidelines and ideas

Your project can entail a field-based examination, a literature-based review, or some combination.

Here are some examples of field-based projects you might consider:

* A vegetation inventory of a particular location
* An assessment of plant biodiversity (e.g. using a set of nested quadrats as described in Chap 9 of Gurevitch et al.)
* An expansion of the stomata density lab that we carried out, with explicit hypotheses stated *a priori*
* An expansion of the nearest-neighbor DBH observation we carried out, when investigating competition

Here are some examples of literature-based review projects you might consider:

* A thorough description of the ecology and/or evolutionary history of a plant clade (at least one member of the clade must be found in our region)
* An analysis of a plant ecology dataset from our region (Prof. Aiello-Lammens can help investigate available datasets)
* An analysis and description of the distribution of a particular plant species or a group of species in our region
* A review of threats to population persistance of plants in our region

## Paper guidelines

The paper should be between 10 and 15 pages, double-space and size 12 font. 
This page count **does not include** figures, tables, and works cited.
It should include in-text citations and a works cited section.
You should follow a standard citation format, and I suggest you use that found in the journal Ecology.
If you are including figures and/or tables from other papers, they must be referenced as such, but given a figure/table legend that makes sense in context of your paper (i.e., number and description).

I recommend that you use a standard scientific article structure when writing your paper.
For a field-based project, this includes Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections. 
For a literature-based review, the structure varies, but generally includes an Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion, as well as several sections between the Intro and the Discussion that break-up the content of the review.

## Presentation guidelines

The presentation should be 12 minutes long, followed by 3-5 minutes of questions.
you can use Power Point, another presentation software, white boards, etc.
