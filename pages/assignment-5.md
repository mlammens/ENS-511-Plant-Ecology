## ENS 511 Plant Ecology - Assignment 5

1. Read Gurevitch et al. *The Ecology of Plants - Chapter 8: Plant Life Histories*. While reading, pay particular attention to the section on *Grime's Triangular Model*, as we will use this information during the 'outside' portion of our lab. After reading, answer  questions 4 and 6 in the **Questions for Further Study (p. 202)** section. 

2. Read Hamilton et al. 2005. Life-history correlates of plant invasiveness at regional and continental scales. Ecology Letters 8: 1066-1074. Come to class prepared to discuss this paper for the later portion of class.
